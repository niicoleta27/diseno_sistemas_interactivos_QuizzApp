# Interactive Systems Design Evaluation Platform

This repository contains a web-based application developed for academic self-assessment within the "Diseño de Sistemas Interactivos" (DSI) course. The platform is designed to test and reinforce knowledge regarding User Experience (UX) principles, usability heuristics, and interaction design methodologies.

## Project Overview

The application serves as a bilingual study tool, allowing users to engage with technical material in both Spanish and Romanian. It is optimized for students who need to master specific academic terminology while ensuring a deep conceptual understanding of interactive system design.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following core files:

* **index.html**: The primary entry point of the application. It features a language selection interface that redirects the user to the appropriate assessment module.
* **QuizzAppDSI_es.html**: The evaluation module configured in Spanish. This file contains the technical question set and justifications aligned with the official course curriculum and Spanish academic standards.
* **QuizzAppDSI_en.html**: The evaluation module configured in English, designed to assist in the conceptual verification of the subject matter.

## Technical Specifications

The platform is built using standard web technologies to ensure cross-browser compatibility and high performance:

* **HTML5**: Utilized for semantic document structure and accessibility.
* **CSS3**: Implemented for a clean, minimalist user interface designed to reduce cognitive load during assessment.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Manages the core logic, including question randomization, real-time response validation, and scoring algorithms.
